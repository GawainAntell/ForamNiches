# ForamNiches
Essential files, in run order:
* BRIDGE GCM data prep
* foram occ data prep
* foram niche construction
* analysis time series
* analysis niches vs climate
* analysis phylo eco
* exploratory plot all spp KDEs (supplemental figures)

These rely on several functions:
* raster brick import fcn
* GSA custom ecospat fcns
* species kde buildr

All other .R files are extraneous and may be too outdated for compatability with current data files.
